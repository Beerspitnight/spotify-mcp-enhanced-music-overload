## How to Use

### 1. Restart Claude Code CLI (if currently running)

The MCP server configuration is loaded at startup, so restart any active Claude Code CLI sessions.

### 2. Verify Tools Are Available

In a new Claude Code CLI session, ask:

```
You: What MCP tools do you have access to?
```

You should see the Spotify tools listed, including:
- `get_top_tracks` (new!)
- `create_curated_playlist_from_top_tracks` (new!)
- `create_playlist`
- `search_tracks`
- `add_tracks_to_playlist`
- `remove_tracks_from_playlist`
- `get_user_playlists`
- `get_playlist_tracks`
- `get_recommendations`
- `find_duplicates`

### 3. Example Usage

#### Get Your Top Tracks
```
You: Show me my top 20 tracks from the last 6 months
```

Claude will use the `get_top_tracks` tool with `time_range="medium_term"`.

#### Create Large Curated Playlist
```
You: Create a playlist called "My Ultimate Mix" with my top 50 tracks from all time, then find 50 similar tracks and add them all
```

Claude Code CLI can handle this large operation better than Claude Desktop due to larger context window.

#### Complex Multi-Step Workflow
```
You:
1. Get my top 30 tracks from the last month
2. Get my top 30 tracks from the last 6 months
3. Find which tracks appear in both lists
4. Create a playlist called "Consistent Favorites" with those tracks
5. Add 20 similar recommendations
```

Claude Code CLI excels at multi-step operations.

## Advantages Over Claude Desktop

### 1. Larger Context Window âœ…
- Claude Code CLI: Much larger context (can handle more tracks/operations)
- Claude Desktop: Limited context (struggles with 100+ tracks)

### 2. Better Error Handling âœ…
- Full terminal integration
- Can see detailed logs if needed
- Better debugging capabilities

### 3. Batch Operations âœ…
- Can handle creating multiple playlists
- Better for bulk track operations
- Won't hit context limits as quickly

### 4. Composability âœ…
- Can combine with other MCP servers (like zen-mcp)
- Full scripting capabilities
- Can save workflows as commands

---

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Create Decade-Based Playlists

```
You: For each decade (80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s), create a playlist with:
- My top 20 tracks from that decade
- 30 recommendations of similar tracks from that decade
```

### Workflow 2: Compare Listening Patterns

```
You:
1. Get my top 20 tracks from the last month
2. Get my top 20 tracks from all time
3. Create two playlists: "Recent Obsessions" and "All-Time Classics"
4. Tell me what genres/artists I'm currently into vs historically
```

### Workflow 3: Smart Genre Playlists

```
You:
1. Get my top 50 tracks
2. Analyze the genres
3. For the top 3 genres, create separate playlists with:
   - My top tracks in that genre
   - Recommendations for similar tracks
```

### Workflow 4: Playlist Cleanup

```
You:
1. Get all my playlists
2. For each playlist, find duplicates
3. Show me which playlists have the most duplicates
4. Remove duplicates from my "Main Mix" playlist
```

## Configuration File Location

**File**: `~/.claude/settings.json`

**Spotify MCP Server Block** (lines 24-37):
```json
"spotify": {
  "description": "Spotify playlist curation and management. 10 tools for smart playlist creation based on listening history.",
  "command": "/opt/miniconda3/bin/python",
  "args": [
    "/Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp/src/server.py"
  ],
  "env": {
    "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID": "4ffb56fb74d149189e1e0b17e31ef4f4",
    "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET": "b3a6e6b6d9684f529a21af1eeb2aeaa8",
    "SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback",
    "SPOTIFY_CACHE_PATH": "/Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp/.spotify_cache"
  },
  "enabled": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Showing Up

**Issue**: Claude Code CLI doesn't show Spotify tools

**Fixes**:
1. Restart Claude Code CLI completely
2. Verify `~/.claude/settings.json` has correct configuration
3. Check that server path is correct:
   ```bash
   ls -la /Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp/src/server.py
   ```
4. Test server manually:
   ```bash
   /opt/miniconda3/bin/python /Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp/src/server.py
   ```

### Authentication Issues

**Issue**: "Not authenticated" errors

**Fix**: The server uses the cached token at `.spotify_cache`. If you get auth errors:

```bash
# Remove cached token
rm /Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp/.spotify_cache

# Run server manually once to re-authenticate
cd /Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp
python src/server.py
# Browser will open for auth, then Ctrl+C to stop
```

### Server Errors

**Issue**: Server won't start or crashes

**Check**:
1. Python path is correct: `/opt/miniconda3/bin/python`
2. Dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bmcmanus/Documents/my_docs/portfolio/spotify-mcp
   pip install -e .
   ```
3. Check logs in Claude Code CLI debug output
