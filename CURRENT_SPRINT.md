## 3. Remaining Tasks (Feature Roadmap)

| ID | Task | Time | Status | Note |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 2.1 | Curation Logic: `discover_weekly_refresher` | 2 hrs | BLOCKED | Requires working `get_recommendations` API access |

## 4. Key Architectural Context

- **Token Storage**: Auth is maintained in the local, Git-ignored `.spotify_cache` file.
- **Logic Separation**: All API calls live in `spotify_client.py`. `server.py` is the dispatcher.
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with `Retry-After` header respect on HTTP 429 errors.
- **Batch Processing**: Operations split into 100-track batches per Spotify API limits.
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints coverage (`Optional`, `List`, `Dict`, `Any`, `Callable`).

## 5. Quality Metrics

**Code Quality**:
- 100% type hint coverage
- Comprehensive error handling
- All methods documented with docstrings
- Security standards compliant

**Testing Status**:
- 9/10 tools tested and operational
- 1/10 blocked by API access (get_recommendations returns 404, affects create_curated_playlist)
- get_top_tracks fully tested (all time ranges working)
- Batch processing verified with 117-track test
- Rate limit retry logic verified

**Documentation**:
- `README.md` - Main user documentation
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Claude Desktop setup
- `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md` - Coding standards
- `SECURITY_STANDARDS.md` - Security guidelines
- Enhancement reports for all major features
