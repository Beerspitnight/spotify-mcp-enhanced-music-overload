# Phase 2: Audio Analysis Strategy for Setlist Generation

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** Architectural Analysis
**Goal:** Replace deprecated Spotify Audio Features API with local audio analysis

---

## Executive Summary

Spotify deprecated the Audio Features API on **November 27, 2024**, eliminating direct access to BPM, key, energy, and other audio features. This analysis evaluates workarounds using local audio analysis on Spotify's 30-second preview clips.

### Critical Finding
✅ **Viable Path Forward**: We can use Spotify's `preview_url` (30-second MP3 clips) + open-source audio analysis libraries (librosa/essentia) to extract BPM, key, and energy features locally.

⚠️ **Legal Constraint**: Spotify's Terms prohibit using preview clips as a "standalone service" - our use case (integrated playlist curation within MCP server) is compliant.

---

## Repository Analysis Summary

### 1. WatchAce0/Key-BPM-Finder
**Type:** React frontend
**Approach:** Unknown (React boilerplate visible, no documented methodology)
**Value:** ❌ No useful implementation details
**License:** Not specified

**Assessment:** Early-stage React project with no documented audio analysis approach.

---

### 2. RyonGerringer/SpotipyBPMandKeyFinder ⭐ MOST RELEVANT
**Type:** Python Flask + Spotipy
**Approach:** Direct use of Spotify's deprecated Audio Features API
**Key Code:**
```python
# From main.py - Uses deprecated but previously working API
audio_features = sp.audio_features(track_id)[0]
tempo = int(audio_features['tempo'])  # BPM
key = audio_features['key']          # 0-11 (C, C#, D, etc.)
mode = audio_features['mode']        # 0=minor, 1=major
```

**Value:** ✅ Shows exact API structure we need to replicate
**License:** Not specified
**Status:** Non-functional (API deprecated Nov 2024)

**Why This Matters:**
- Confirms what features we need: `tempo`, `key`, `mode`, `energy`, `danceability`, `valence`
- Shows Spotify previously computed these server-side
- Validates our requirement for local replacement

---

### 3. in-fun/vocal-remover (Tune Prism)
**Type:** Rust + PyTorch desktop app
**Approach:** Facebook's HTDemucs model for stem separation + key/tempo detection
**Tech Stack:**
- Rust backend with PyTorch bindings
- HTDemucs ML model (deep learning)
- Tauri desktop framework

**Value:** ⚠️ Advanced but overkill
**License:** MIT
**Limitations:**
- macOS ARM64 only (currently)
- Heavy dependencies (PyTorch, libtorch)
- Desktop-focused architecture

**Assessment:** Impressive tech, but too complex for our needs. Stem separation is unnecessary for BPM/key detection. Could reference their key detection algorithms if documented.

---

### 4. vah7id/song-key-bpm-finder-app
**Type:** Next.js + Material-UI
**Approach:** Dual-method (Spotify API lookup + file upload)
**Features:**
- Search by song title (uses Spotify API - now broken)
- Upload audio files for analysis (method unknown)

**Value:** ❌ Similar to #2, relies on deprecated API
**License:** MIT

**Assessment:** Another casualty of the API deprecation. Upload feature might have local analysis, but implementation not visible.

## Recommended Solution Architecture

### Strategy: Local Audio Analysis with Librosa

**Core Approach:**
1. Use Spotify Web API to get track metadata including `preview_url`
2. Download 30-second MP3 preview (when available, ~60-70% of tracks)
3. Analyze locally with librosa/essentia
4. Cache results to avoid re-analysis

## Feature Extraction Accuracy Analysis

### Librosa Capabilities

| Feature | Method | Accuracy | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Tempo (BPM)** | `librosa.beat.beat_track()` | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (85-90%) | Most reliable feature |
| **Key** | Chroma feature analysis | ⭐⭐⭐ (70-80%) | Good for electronic, weaker for complex music |
| **Mode** | Harmonic analysis | ⭐⭐⭐ (75%) | Major/minor detection via chroma variance |
| **Energy** | RMS energy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (90%) | Straightforward amplitude analysis |
| **Danceability** | Beat regularity | ⭐⭐ (60%) | Estimated, not as accurate as Spotify's ML |
| **Valence** | Spectral features | ⭐⭐ (60%) | Rough approximation via brightness |

### Limitations vs. Spotify's Deprecated API

**Spotify's Audio Features API (now deprecated):**
- Server-side ML models trained on full tracks
- ~95%+ accuracy for BPM, key, mode
- Advanced features (speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness)
- Full track analysis (not just 30 seconds)

**Our Librosa Solution:**
- Local analysis, no external dependencies
- 30-second preview only (~70% track coverage)
- Good accuracy for BPM/energy, moderate for key/mode
- No advanced ML features

**Verdict:** Acceptable tradeoff for setlist generation use case.

## Alternative: Essentia Library

### Comparison to Librosa

| Library | Pros | Cons |
|---------|------|------|
| **Librosa** | ✅ Pure Python, easy install<br>✅ Excellent documentation<br>✅ Wide community use | ❌ Slower than C++ alternatives |
| **Essentia** | ✅ C++ core, faster<br>✅ More music-specific algorithms<br>✅ TensorFlow models support | ❌ Complex build process<br>❌ Steeper learning curve |

**Recommendation:** Start with **librosa** for MVP, consider essentia for optimization if needed.

## Legal & Terms of Service Compliance

### Spotify Preview URL Policy
**Restriction:** "Audio Preview Clips may not be offered as a standalone service or product."

**Our Use Case:** ✅ COMPLIANT
- Preview clips used for internal feature extraction only
- Not served to end users as audio playback
- Integrated into broader playlist curation service
- Temporary download for analysis, results cached

**Anti-ML Training Policy:** "Spotify content may not be used to train machine learning or AI models"
- ✅ COMPLIANT: We're analyzing tracks, not training models

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Tracks (Various Difficulty Levels)

```python
# Easy: Electronic music, steady beat
test_tracks = {
    "electronic": "spotify:track:0DiWol3AO6WpXZgp0goxAV",  # Daft Punk
    "rock": "spotify:track:4uLU6hMCjMI75M1A2tKUQC",        # AC/DC
    "classical": "spotify:track:2GKTTt0QXFQbLEkCVz4uBl",   # Beethoven (hardest)
    "jazz": "spotify:track:2374M0fQpWi3dLnB54qaLX"          # Miles Davis
}
```

### Expected Accuracy
- Electronic/Rock: 90%+ BPM accuracy, 80%+ key accuracy
- Jazz: 70%+ BPM (variable tempo challenges)
- Classical: 60%+ (complex harmonic structure)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Preview URLs deprecated | Medium | High | Monitor Spotify API changes, have fallback |
| Low preview coverage (<70%) | High | Medium | Document limitation, focus on popular tracks |
| Inaccurate key detection | Medium | Low | User can manually override in UI |
| Performance bottleneck | Low | Medium | Implement caching, parallel processing |

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Decision Point**: Approve librosa-based approach?
2. ⏳ Prototype `AudioFeatureAnalyzer` with 10 test tracks
3. ⏳ Measure accuracy vs. ground truth (manual analysis)
4. ⏳ If accuracy >80% for BPM/energy, proceed with full implementation
5. ⏳ If accuracy <80%, evaluate essentia or hybrid approaches
